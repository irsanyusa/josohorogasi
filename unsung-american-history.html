But, while the nearly 250 years since then have been chock full of major milestones, not every moment that shaped the country gets the credit it deserves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With that in mind, TIME asked 15 experts to each nominate an unsung moment from American history. These are events that, though not necessarily widely known today, either changed the national story in some important way or embodied a significant current. And if you don’t know about them yet, these historians will explain why they think you should.<br></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here, their choices:<br></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Oneida allies help George Washington’s army at Valley Forge (1777-8)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/valley-forge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the Revolutionary War, the Oneida allies of the revolutionary army walked hundreds of miles from their homeland in what is now upstate New York to relieve the famine at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-78. They carried hundreds of bushels of white corn on their backs and, once in George Washington’s encampment, they taught the revolutionaries how to prepare it so it was edible, and thus saved the starving army. But the role tribal nations played on the side of the United States during that conflict — and by extension in every subsequent one — has been largely ignored. Perhaps most ignobly, Washington himself seems to have forgotten his allies: immediately after the war he burned and <a href=# rel=noopener>destroyed</a> dozens of Iroquois villages in upstate New York to make way for settlement and in indiscriminate retribution for the help some tribes gave the British. I think it’s safe to say the true rich legacy of Indian/Anglo relations has been elided in favor of American myths and fantasies, and there is no place in such myths for the sense that America was not made in opposition to Native life but in relation to it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">David Treuer, a professor of English at the University of Southern California, is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Read more about George Washington, here in the TIME Vault</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Congress decides the Constitution will have amendments (1789)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/constitution.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you ask most Americans to name something in the Constitution, there’s a good chance they’d name one of the first ten amendments, better known as the Bill of Rights. They might single out the freedom of speech or religion, or the right to bear arms, or prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. But before the Founders could determine which rights to safeguard, they first had to decide how amendments would be added. In August of 1789, debate broke out in the First Federal Congress over this very issue. James Madison preferred that amendments be seamlessly integrated into the text, while Roger Sherman fought to have them added at the end like an appendix. Madison lost this fight — with enormous ramifications for the way we see and understand the Constitution today. Had Madison prevailed, there would be no First or Second Amendment; their various previsions would have simply been scattered throughout Article I. Moreover, there would be no “Bill of Rights” at all. It would take well over a century before Americans identified the first amendments in this now-famous way. Only because they were set apart, textually and visually, from the first seven articles was this ever possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jonathan Gienapp, an assistant professor of history at Stanford, is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Second Creation: Fixing the American Constitution in the Founding Era</a>.<br></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Read more about the Constitution, here in the TIME Vault</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>New York City gets a botanical garden (1801)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/unsung-moments-botanical.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1801, on 20 acres of Manhattan farmland, an American doctor founded the first public botanical garden in the United States. David Hosack’s vision was for a medical and agricultural research facility that would nurture his young nation. He amassed a collection of more than 3,000 native and non-native species, among whose contributors were Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson. Hosack used his garden to conduct some of the earliest pharmacological research in the United States and helped bring into being the first generation of professional American botanists. Meanwhile, his medical students went on to found American hospitals, clinics and medical journals. At the time of his death, Hosack was famous in the United States and Europe — in part for his civic work and in part for his role as attending physician at the 1804 duel of his friends Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. In 1814, Columbia University acquired Hosack’s land from the state of New York, which had purchased it from Hosack to run for the public benefit. Columbia eventually leased the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr., who built Rockefeller Center on the site; few know that land was once a garden — and yet today there are botanical gardens conducting environmental research and education in every state, continuing the work Hosack started.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Victoria Johnson, an associate professor of urban policy & planning at Hunter College of the City University of New York, is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>American Eden: David Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Read more about that land, here on TIME.com</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Maria Stewart speaks in Boston (1832)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In April 28, 1832, African-American writer and lecturer Maria Stewart spoke before Boston’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Afric-American Female Intelligence Society</a> — becoming the first American woman on record to speak about politics to an audience comprised of both men and women. In her lectures on the challenges of ending slavery and securing civil rights, Stewart called into question men’s leadership, suggesting that it was time for black women to exercise greater public influence. Though she had supporters, many thought Stewart had gone too far. Ridicule led Stewart to deliver her “farewell” address in September 1833. She was not done, however, and spent the balance of her life training future generations of young black women to enter public life. Early histories of the women’s suffrage movement too often obscured the roles played by those, like Stewart, who had come before its authors, who included Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Their version was long accepted as authoritative. Historian Marilyn Richardson revealed a new story when she recovered Stewart’s legacy for us in her 1987 book <a href=# rel=noopener>Maria W. Stewart: America’s First Black Woman Political Writer</a>. Stewart’s 1832 speech remains a lesson for today as we witness the rise of a new generation of women of color in politics — they are Maria Stewart’s daughters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Martha S.

Her book was one of the first works on comparative religions written by an American, and remarkable for its dispassionate consideration of non-Christian religions, including Islam. As a “womanist” and abolitionist, she admired that Islamic law allowed women to own property and considered manumission praiseworthy, forbidding believers to enslave one another. She also thought Christians hypocritical in ignoring the violence of the Bible and focusing overly on that in the Qur’an. Although Child was one of the more successful novelists and essayists of the 19th century, she is now little taught and is no longer widely read. Our current assumptions about 19th century American thought on both Islam and women might be very different if her fame had endured.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Juan Cole, the Richard P.

Readers of Harper’s were presumably convinced of slavery’s moral evils, but this didn’t mean that they didn’t still hold racial biases against African Americans that made them uncritically accept the logics of racism. The <a href=# rel=noopener>truly pressing fear</a> this image was meant to capitalize on was that if we can’t read race by just looking, and people considered legally black could pass for white, then what was to stop the same system of legal slavery from mistaking free white citizens for the enslaved?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This story underlines the <a href=# rel=noopener>impossibility</a> of a system of slavery based on race, but images and articles like this one are under-known and under-discussed.

Another is likely some discomfort around the idea that Northern abolitionists could be both vehemently anti-slavery and also racist. So often we narrate history as if there are definitive lines drawn between good and evil. But actually historical events are animated by the actions of individuals, who are always much more contradictory in their viewpoints and politics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Danielle Bainbridge, an assistant professor in the department of theater at Northwestern, is the host of the PBS Digital Studios web series <a href=# rel=noopener>The Origin of Everything.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Read more about abolition, here on TIME.com</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Henrietta Wood wins restitution (1878)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1878, a black woman named Henrietta Wood won an early and largely unknown case of restitution for slavery. Though born enslaved in Kentucky in 1818 or 1820, Wood had been living as a free woman in Cincinnati in 1853 when she was kidnapped and re-enslaved by a white Kentuckian named Zebulon Ward; she ended up living in slavery until after the Civil War. But in 1869, Wood returned to Cincinnati and filed a lawsuit against Ward for $20,000 in damages and lost wages. A federal court handed her a verdict for $2,500, an amount worth $60,000 today. It is the largest known sum ever awarded by a U.S. court in restitution for slavery, and it received widespread press coverage at the time — but, as Reconstruction gave way to the Jim Crow era and stories like hers were obscured by Lost Cause myths, it was forgotten by almost everyone except Wood and her son, who went on to become a lawyer in Chicago. Yet this unsung moment in history deserves to be revisited. It not only shows that formerly enslaved people struggled to win reparations from the very beginning, but also serves as a case study of the differences that restitution could make.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Caleb McDaniel, an associate professor of history at Rice University, is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Sweet Taste of Liberty: A True Story of Slavery and Restitution in America</a>, forthcoming Sept. 2 from Oxford University Press.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Read more about reparations, here on TIME.com</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Chinese immigrants refuse to register (1892)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/immigrants.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After the <a href=# rel=noopener>Geary Act of 1892</a> renewed America’s policy of excluding Chinese immigrants based on their race and class — and also required those who were already here to register with the U.S. government or face deportation — Chinese immigrants in the United States participated in an act of mass civil disobedience. Nearly 90,000 Chinese immigrants refused to register by the deadline, grinding U.S. immigration control to a halt. The U.S. simply did not have the money or manpower to deport 90,000 immigrants, so it could not enforce the law; a man named Fong Yue Ting also challenged the law before the Supreme Court. But, although the protest marked a high point in immigrant activism, the court ruled that the U.S. did have the power to deport immigrants even if they were long-term residents in the United States. Following the ruling, most of the protesters relented and registered with the U.S. government, and their fight was forgotten by many. And yet Justice Stephen Field delivered a dissent in <a href=# rel=noopener>Fong Yue Ting v.

But rural Americans had had to trek dozens of miles to their nearest Post Office, not even knowing whether there was any mail waiting for them. When Congress voted for Rural Free Delivery, or “RFD,” politicians hoped that daily mail delivery could get vital information to farmers and ease the isolation of farm life. Millions of rural people eagerly subscribed to daily newspapers and monthly magazines once RFD made it affordable, and the mail-order catalogs that came through the post put some of the luxuries of urban life within reach of rural families: wrist watches, French lace, electric toasters. RFD had some unintended consequences too; when farmers stopped traveling to town to get the mail and started shopping in catalogs, local businesses suffered. Because it proved difficult for postmen to navigate narrow muddy roads, the federal government devoted funds to improve post roads, first in 1916 and again in 1936. This made a vast difference for rural people’s ability to take their crops to market and send their children to school. Rural Free Delivery cost the government $40 million per year in the 1910s, and that money improved access to goods and information for millions of people. But we don’t always make the connection between the tax we pay and the services that benefit us, and when government programs work well, we sometimes forget they’re there at all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Julia Guarneri, a university lecturer in American history at the University of Cambridge, is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Newsprint Metropolis: City Papers and the Making of Modern Americans.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Read more about Rural Free Delivery, here in the TIME Vault</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Texas Legislature investigates the Rangers (1919)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/texas.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Between 1910 and 1920, state law enforcement officers and Anglo vigilantes in the Texas-Mexico borderlands murdered hundreds of ethnic Mexican residents, American citizens and Mexican nationals alike. Assailants rarely faced arrest and grand juries regularly failed to indict the accused for wrongdoing. For members of law enforcement, a culture of impunity prevailed. The abuses were so extensive that in 1919 the Texas legislature agreed to investigate charges. The records left by the investigation of the Texas Rangers leave a clear record of state crimes but also a record of state agents attempting to justify the violence. On Feb. 19, the commission <a href=# rel=noopener>declared that</a>, though the charges of misconduct were “established by sufficient and competent evidence,” the border remained a dangerous place.

Roosevelt. Although the identifying digits were overshadowed by the nation-changing program of which they were part, those numbers would become affixed to nearly every American life across the next century, spurring new uses of punch cards and filing systems as well as novel dilemmas around data. Over time, the SSN became a de facto national ID, used by banks and insurance agencies, to track tax returns, and to identify college students. By the 1970s, the number indexed a wealth of sensitive information in computer data banks, prompting major privacy legislation. In our own time the SSN is as often associated with risk — from identity theft or data breaches — as security, something that could not have been anticipated by the newly numbered Americans of the 1930s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sarah E.

Sexual psychopath laws fell out of favor in the 1960s and ’70s, when psychiatrists, criminologists, LGBTQ activists and others challenged their legitimacy — especially for the way in which those laws were used to pathologize and criminalize LGBTQ people.

The attention paid to The Exorcist wasn’t just a matter of horror-movie fun: it also revealed early stirrings of a conservative religious revival that would alter the political and cultural landscape of the country. Americans were not simply looking for a good scare, they were drawn to a story that documented in painstaking detail the failure of science, medicine and psychology.
