But it begins with each of us living a connected life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And there are three ingredients we must cultivate to live a connected life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first is empathy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Empathy is choosing to see ourselves in another despite our differences.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s recognizing that the same humanity—the same desire for meaning, fulfillment and security—exists in each of us, even if it’s expressed uniquely.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Empathy is what creates our desire to build connection and to solve or even prevent conflicts from family disagreements to global crises.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I entered the world of medicine, I was taught in subtle and not-so-subtle ways that people living with addiction had a character flaw.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But then I began to listen more closely to the stories of my patients.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One young woman I cared for told me that her road to addiction began with a simple prescription for morphine given to her after a routine surgery. Her story could have been anyone’s story. I realized it could have been mine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A few months ago, I met a young man I’ll call Jason whose mother was a public school educator. His mother told me that her son was kind and responsible and hardworking—the kind of child any parent would want. She did everything to bring him up right and made sure that he had good role models.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One day, when she went to visit Jason in college, she saw a disheveled man going through the dumpster outside her son’s apartment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She took him to be a homeless person. As she got closer, she was shocked to realize that it was her son. Jason had developed a substance use disorder that began with pain pills and later led to heroin and cocaine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His mother chose in that moment not to give up on him, so he decided not to give up on himself either. Together, they found the help of professionals who chose to devote their careers to helping strangers who are living with addiction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, Jason is in recovery, he has secured a job, he has rebuilt his relationships—thanks to his mother’s love, his own fierce determination and the empathy of those who chose to help him on his journey.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Empathy has the power to bring together people who would otherwise never meet. It has the power to teach us and to reach us in moments of isolation when we think nobody understands.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, the world needs us to widen our circle of empathy to include more people.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The second ingredient that helps us live a connected life is optimism. Optimism is our ability to see the good in others—and in ourselves—especially during dark times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I was younger, my family suddenly and unexpectedly lost all of our life savings to a man we had trusted as a friend. The financial loss was difficult, especially because my sister and I were both in college. But the breach of trust was even more painful.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I learned a lot from watching how my parents handled that extended time of hardship. One option we had was to retreat in anger—to recognize that it was unlikely we would rebuild our savings and swear we would never trust people again.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But my parents chose a different path. They chose to believe that most people are still fundamentally good and that their light outshines their darkness.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trusting others in the face of betrayal was not easy, but it was necessary and it was ultimately healing. We were blessed to find friends and strangers who stepped forward to help us in unexpected ways. We built new friendships and it felt good to trust people again.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But my parents also chose to believe that our capacity to respond to adversity was greater than we could even imagine, especially when we stuck together.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So over the next few years, we would have regular family meetings around the dining table where we talked about how we would handle everything from tuition payments to weekly grocery expenses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We worked hard to get back on our feet. And there were plenty of difficult moments when we didn’t know how we would make things work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But my parents taught me that optimism is the hand that keeps the door of possibility open, and that is what saw us through.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, I know being optimistic isn’t always easy. There is real hardship in the world. And we live in a time where being cynical is alluring at times, even cool. Being cynical also seems safe. It doesn’t risk disappointment when your expectations are not met.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But I would caution you that cynicism in the long term erodes our capacity for happiness. It dims our eyes to the beauty and blessings of the world around us. It makes us fearful to take risks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Optimists, on the other hand, don’t let long odds discourage them. Some would say they Bear Down.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They take a chance on love. They dare to imagine a better world and they build the technology, institutions and social movements to make it so.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Optimists keep faith that they will find good people in the world even when they are disappointed from time to time. They build bridges with people different from themselves because they understand that our shared humanity outweighs any differences we may have.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Optimism is what allows us to choose the path of connection over isolation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The third ingredient you will need to live a connected life is courage. Empathy feeds our desire for connection. Optimism helps us believe that connection is possible. But courage is what enables us to act and make our connections to people real.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When the Twin Towers fell on 9/11—on that fateful morning 15 years ago—thousands of Manhattan residents fled south looking for an escape from the growing inferno behind them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But instead of relief, they were greeted by the unforgiving waters of the Hudson which offered no path to safety. The panicked crowd continued to grow until the U.S. Coast Guard made a key decision: They issued a radio call to every civilian ship in the area asking them to join in an unprecedented citizen rescue mission.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The response was overwhelming. Within minutes, the Hudson was covered with scores of boats streaking toward the southern tip of Manhattan. They pierced through the dense cloud of dust and debris and brought soot-covered people on board, offered them water and ferried them to safety.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In nine hours, nearly 500,000 people were rescued. The 9/11 Boat Lift became the largest boat rescue in the history of the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, the 9/11 Boat Lift was powered by ordinary people. They were never trained in emergency response. They would never have described themselves as heroes. And they had every reason to flee for safety themselves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But their courage is what allowed them to act.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vincent Ardolino, the captain of the Amberjack, said his wife thought that he was a maniac for wanting to take his boat toward Manhattan that morning after the call. But he knew that he had to go.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Never go through life saying you should have,” he said later reflecting on that decision. “If you want to do something, you do it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">[APPLAUSE]</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Empathy, optimism and courage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These are the qualities I wish for you that are the foundation for a connected life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As you set off to begin the rest of your lives, as you think about the people in your circle of love—the family that is with you, the friends and teachers who supported you, the children you may one day have—ask yourself, “What can I do to create the world they deserve, a world that is prosperous, safe and full of possibility?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We can start by strengthening our connections to each other by rebuilding our sense of community.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We can begin by living a connected life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These next few years, they’re going to will be a whirlwind for you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My elementary school physical education teacher, Mr. Peterson, told me on my last day of sixth grade that each day to come would go by faster and faster.

And it only seems to be getting faster.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That is why I also wish for you moments of pause where you can stop, rest and reflect.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This might be a few minutes to write in your journal, to meditate or to simply breathe and observe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The world won’t automatically give us those moments to pause – we have to create them. But it is those moments of calm when we gather ourselves and set forth with a clear mind and renewed heart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And if we ever forget the power of pausing, we need only take our hand and put our hand on our chest and remember the lesson of our heart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The heart operates in two phases: Systole, where it pumps blood to the vital organs, and diastole, where it relaxes. Most people think that systole is where all the action is and the more time in systole the better. But diastole—the relaxation phase—is where the coronary blood vessels fill and supply life sustaining oxygen to the heart muscle itself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pausing, it turns out, is what sustains the heart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’d like you to take 10 seconds with me and close your eyes.
