Whether you’re shopping for a partner, friend, family member or yourself, flowers are an easy way to show that you care, in a way that really packs a punch. With Valentine’s Day coming up, many couples will be eyeing up beautiful arrangements of roses and other romantic blooms, but a bouquet is just as welcome on <a rel=alternate href=#>Mother’s Day</a>, birthdays—or just because.</p><p>But where should you buy the flowers? “If you’re looking for a bouquet or an arrangement, yes you can check out your deli, but first check your local florist and then the larger delivery services,” says Lindsay Jones, floral and event designer at Studio Jones in New York. If you don’t have a go-to local expert, the good news is that a gorgeous bunch of flowers is only an order away. The best flower delivery services take on the task of arranging, packaging and delivering your flowers so all you need to do is pick out the bouquet you think they’ll love most. Depending on your budget, the delivery window and the style of arrangement you’re looking for, there will be a flower delivery service for you that gets the right bouquet delivered on time.</p><p>To help you find the best bouquets for all your flower arrangement needs, we’ve compiled this list of the best flower delivery services for every occasion.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-flower-delivery-service>Our top picks for the best flower delivery service</h2><h3>Best flower delivery service for unique bouquet designs: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Farmgirl Flowers</a></h3><p>It can be easy to lose the personal touch when you’re operating on a national scale, but Farmgirl Flowers has retained its rustic, farm-fresh sensibility. Female-founded and predominantly female-run, the brand incorporates a mix of rare rose varieties and other unique flowers into each of their trendy, attractive designs. There is a big emphasis on seasonality and each bouquet is wrapped in upcycled burlap from coffee roasters, which enhances the artisanal aesthetic. You won’t find any brightly saturated hues here as everything leans towards a softer palette of complementary colors, but the resulting bouquets are very tasteful. A range of flowers are always available in the “free ship shop” for greater value, but there is no same-day or next-day delivery. Ultimately, if you are willing to pay a bit more for sustainable blooms and a farmhouse aesthetic, then we think you’ll be very happy with Farmgirl Flowers.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: No same-day or next-day delivery, some free shipping</li><li>Price range: $49+</li><li>Subscription option: Yes</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Tasteful arrangements of interesting, unique flowers</li><li>Packaging is attractive and sustainable</li><li>The Free Ship Shop ensures added value for a range of bouquets</li><li>Subscriptions are available starting at $59.99</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>No same-day or next-day delivery</li><li>Arrangements are limited to one specific aesthetic</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Farmgirl Flowers offer the ultimate arrangements of artisanal farmhouse blooms, with the attractive and eye-catching designs being worth the slightly higher prices.</p><h3>Best flower delivery service for variety: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Bouqs Company</a></h3><p>Whether you’re looking for a small yet vibrant arrangement or a deluxe extravaganza, The Bouqs Company has something for you. Not only do they offer a wide array of color schemes, flower types and arrangement styles, but every bouquet is carefully packaged and arrives in consistently great condition. The florists here use a range of interesting blooms that create very stylish, expensive-looking bouquets—there are no “filler flowers” here. Each arrangement is available in three sizes, so you can scale the bouquet to suit the occasion and your budget. Subscribers also benefit from 30% off many popular choices, with the ability to customize each delivery as much or as little as desired.</p><p>Same-day delivery is available for many options on the website, although these deliveries are fulfilled by local florists and may not be quite as perfect as The Bouqs Company’s own deliveries. Shipping prices are also not included in the listed price, so keep that in mind when deciding on your budget. However, we think the little bit extra you spend is very much worth it for the quality of flowers you get, time after time.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Same-day and next-day available</li><li>Price range: $49+</li><li>Subscription option: Yes, with free shipping</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Flowers stay vibrant and fresh for much longer than other bouquets</li><li>Wide array of styles, colors and unique flowers</li><li>Consistently delivers bouquets in perfect condition</li><li>Substantially discounted pricing for subscriptions</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Shipping is not included in the sticker price</li><li>Prices start at around $50, just for the flowers</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Bouqs Company is our go-to flower delivery service for beautiful bouquets that suit every taste, are consistently high-quality and can be available same-day.</p><h3>Best flower service for local deliveries: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Teleflora</a></h3><p>Teleflora may be headquartered in Los Angeles, California but it counts over 10,000 member florists throughout the USA and Canada. What this means is that Teleflora is able to work with local flower services on each order, ensuring fresh blooms in great condition and fast shipping no matter where your gift recipient is based. There is even a global presence of 20,000 florists outside of North America, in case you’re sending flowers further afield. This is ideal if you live far away from the person you are sending flowers to and therefore don’t know the local delivery options; order from Teleflora and they’ll do the hard work for you! The majority of bouquets are delivered same-day and come in a vase, for enhanced presentation and practicality. In terms of design, these arrangements skew traditional, in bright colors or classic reds and with lots of roses and lilies.

The arrangements are more traditional, featuring a lot of familiar favorites such as roses, lilies and tulips. If your recipient appreciates the look of a more classic bouquet, then you’re sure to find something here that will make both them and your wallet happy. Depending on the delivery area, there may even be some bouquets available that are designed by local florists, for something a bit more unique. If you’re looking to supplement your bouquet with some other gift options, then 1-800-Flowers is able to include a range of products from their brand partners such as food, jewelry and even toys. A bonus for last-minute gifters: Orders placed before 2 p.m. in the recipient’s time zone qualify for same-day delivery.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Same-day and next-day available</li><li>Price range: $35+</li><li>Subscription option: Yes</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable price options</li><li>Same-day delivery available</li><li>Great variety of add-on gifts, themed for every occasion</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Floral options and styling are a bit limited</li><li>General quality looks a little less impressive than more expensive options</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Flowers are always lovely to receive and 1-800-Flowers makes it possible to send a pretty bouquet at an affordable price, to arrive as early as today.</p><h3>Best flower delivery service that offers same-day delivery: <a rel=nofollow href=#>FTD Flowers</a></h3><p>Whether you’ve forgotten to order flowers for a major holiday or an occasion has suddenly come up that would benefit from a bouquet, same-day flower delivery can save the day. Many delivery services offer a few arrangements with same-day shipping, but FTD Flowers stands apart from the rest thanks to its expansive assortment of options that are same-day eligible. By partnering with local florists around the country, FTD Flowers is able to commit to fast shipping for a greater number of bouquets than we’ve found elsewhere; we counted 86 at the time of writing. These arrangements may not be the most unique or notable, but the quality is reliable and the large assortment means you are likely to find something suitable whatever the occasion. You can even add gifts like candles or chocolates to your order, for a little more wow-factor.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Same-day delivery available</li><li>Price range: $40+</li><li>Subscription option: None</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Vast array of bouquets available for same-day delivery</li><li>Good mix of price options</li><li>Option to customize with extra gifts or buy an existing set</li><li>Vase is included</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Quite traditional arrangements; lower “wow factor”</li><li>No subscription option available</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Let FTD Flowers save the day with reliable same-day delivery across a wide range of classic bouquets, all at various price points.</p><h3>Best flower delivery service for DIY bouquet kits: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bouquet Box</a></h3><p>Arrange-it-yourself kits are a relatively new thing in the world of floral delivery services, but they’re a great way to take up a new skill—and a great <a rel=alternate href=#>gift idea</a>, too. While kits can cost more than picking up cut flowers from the supermarket, they offer variety (you don’t have to pay for a whole bouquet of one type of flower if you’ll only use a couple in an arrangement, for example) but most importantly, creative direction (when you’re not quite sure about the bouquet you want to make). Bouquet Box is a unique bouquet kit option that offers a designer arrangement to create each month. Each month’s design is different, and features seasonal flowers. In addition to blooms, you also get the tools you need to complete the arrangement.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Delivery</a> is based on the window in which you order, orders are accepted weekly</li><li>Price range: $99+</li><li>Subscription option: Yes</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>There’s a new bouquet to create each month</li><li>Subscriptions provide discounted pricing</li><li>Tools are included with your kit</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Limited to the bouquet design that month</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Bouquet Box is a convenient way to try your hand at floral design, with a DIY kit that includes everything from blooms to tools.</p><h3>Best value online flower delivery service: <a rel=nofollow href=#>From You Flowers</a></h3><p>Lower prices don’t always mean better value, not if the standard of flowers is also low. From You Flowers combines affordable pricing with consistent quality so that you can be sure you’re getting your money’s worth. With a large range of popular bouquets priced around $40 – and many more priced slightly lower and higher—there is an abundance of choice for every budget. The displays are also vibrantly colored in a range of color schemes, with a few unexpected arrangements mixed in with the classic styles. If you’re not set on flowers, From You Flowers also offers a selection of other greenery and botanicals that can be delivered to your recipient. Same day shipping is available for many of the bouquets, so you can take advantage of the competitive pricing even when shopping last minute.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Same-day delivery available</li><li>Price range: $31+</li><li>Subscription option: No</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Good range of pricing for every budget</li><li>Brightly hued blooms in every color scheme</li><li>Extra gift items available</li><li>Large range of bouquets available for same-day delivery</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Arrangements skew traditional and classic</li><li>Flower quality is a little lower than the more high-end services</li><li>No subscription available</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Whatever your budget, From You Flowers has a range of attractive if traditional bouquets, with most available for same-day delivery.</p><h3>Best online flower delivery service for long-lasting blooms: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Venus et Fleur</a></h3><p>Flower displays can’t last forever, but some arrangements will last much longer than others. To ensure their bouquets and arrangements last up to a full year, Venus et Fleur preserve their blooms and treat them with synthetic scents so that you can enjoy the aroma of fresh flowers for months on end. Unsurprisingly, this longevity will come at a price: Venus et Fleur is by far the most expensive delivery service on this list and is a favorite of celebrities like the Kardashians. They also specialize in roses in various and unique colors, although this offering will expand in the summertime to several other varieties of flower. However, if you or your recipient are a rose purist that wants to enjoy these blooms month after month, Venus et Fleur could be a worthwhile investment. For a minimalist statement look, opt for their single roses or small bouquets, or go big with one of their lavish large-format arrangements.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Overnight and next-day shipping available</li><li>Price range: $44+ (for a single rose)</li><li>Subscription option: No</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Truly luxurious displays</li><li>Unique color options of roses, including baby blue, deep purple and papaya</li><li>Longevity of the blooms offsets some of the cost</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Limited to mostly just roses</li><li>Very expensive</li><li>No same-day delivery</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For the most extravagant, long-lasting rose displays, invest in an arrangement by celebrity favorite flower service Venus et Fleur.</p><h3>Best subscription flower delivery service: <a rel=nofollow href=#>BloomsyBox</a></h3><p>Why gift someone a single bouquet of flowers when you can give them flowers every month? Subscription flower delivery services are a great way to bring joy to your recipient on a regular basis and BloomsyBox makes it easier than ever. Its subscription offerings include a monthly option, with various price plans to accommodate different budgets, as well as a weekly or biweekly option. But where BloomsyBox really shines is its specialty collections, such as the Tropical Selection, Pet-Safe Blooms and NYBG Subscription (inspired by the New York Botanical Garden.) This allows you to find the perfect theme for your recipient, even if they’re more into classic roses or green plants. While none of these options are below $59.99 per order, they all include free shipping and all flowers are harvested from eco-friendly farms, so you can be confident of the quality and sustainability of every purchase. Individual bouquets and next-day delivery are also available, if you want to add a one-off display at any time.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Free with subscriptions, next-day available</li><li>Price range: $59.99+ for subscriptions, $44.99 for individual</li><li>Subscription option: Multiple options</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Subscriptions are available in themes for more specialized gift-giving</li><li>Weekly, biweekly and monthly delivery options (and next-day for individual bouquets)</li><li>Free shipping for all subscriptions</li><li>All flowers are harvested from eco-friendly farms</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>No subscriptions available under $60</li><li>No same-day delivery</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For specialized, eco-friendly subscriptions in a mix of themes and budgets, you can’t go wrong with BloomsyBox and its range of flowers, plants and coffee.</p><h3>Best online succulent delivery service: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lula’s Garden</a></h3><p>Not everyone loves flowers, but that doesn’t mean they won’t enjoy some greenery. If you or your recipient are more into easy plants you can enjoy long-term, then you may want to consider sending a succulent display from Lula’s Garden. Organized into different sizes of garden, you have the option of picking a single small or medium succulent box, or scaling up towards a deluxe assortment (although you can’t select the specific succulents you get). You can then customize the signature sleeve to suit your occasion from a prettily designed range of options. Once received, you won’t need to repot the succulents but can leave them as is in their specially designed box. Even better, your purchase will have provided six months of safe water for someone in the developing world. Lula’s Garden also sells a few plants and candles, mostly in gift sets that are particularly well suited for housewarmings. However, keep in mind that there is only same-day and hand delivery in the Los Angeles area; national orders are shipped using Fedex 1-3 day delivery.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Same-day delivery in LA; 1-3 day shipping nationwide</li><li>Price range: $28+</li><li>Subscription option: No</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Prices start as low as $28</li><li>Packaging allows you to customize the sleeve, plus it includes a water pipette</li><li>Various garden options allow for different budgets and designs</li><li>Each purchase provides 6 months of safe water for one person in the developing world</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>No same-day or hand-delivery outside of LA</li><li>Shoppers can’t select the individual succulents in the larger garden boxes</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Succulent lovers can’t go wrong with Lula’s Garden, which offers a range of different succulent garden sizes and donates water to the developing world with every purchase.</p><h3>Best flower delivery service for rose bouquets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ode à la Rose</a></h3><p>Roses are beloved for a reason and it’s easy to see why with Ode à la Rose’s selection of flower arrangements. Alongside its classic rose bouquets, the flower delivery service also offers a selection of rose-studded signature mixed bouquets, centerpieces and large-format displays. Bouquets come in traditional rose colors (pinks, reds and whites) but also some brightly colored displays of orange, fuschia and purple, so you can choose between classic or eclectic designs. For anyone looking for preserved roses, Ode à la Rose does also sell a few different preserved arrangements at a higher price point. You can customize the size of many bouquets to suit your budget, or add a vase or other gift item to accompany your flowers. Unfortunately, same-day and hand-delivery is only available in a few major metropolitan areas, but Ode à la Rose does carefully package their other displays so that they arrive the next day in great condition. Overall, these are slightly more expensive than some options on this list, but you’ll see the difference.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Same-day and next-day available in New York, LA, Chicago, Austin, Miami and Washington DC</li><li>Price range: $58+</li><li>Subscription option: Yes</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Stylishly designed bouquets in multiple colors and sizes</li><li>Roses are a highlight but not the only floral available</li><li>High quality vases and add-ons enhance the overall gifting experience</li><li>There is the option for large-format or preserved flowers</li><li>Option to subscribe on a flexible basis</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not as affordable as other delivery services</li><li>Same-day and hand delivery is only available in a few metropolitan areas</li><li>Clear focus on roses only</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Roses are celebrated and shown in their best light in the flower arrangements sold by Ode à la Rose, which come in every size and a vibrant array of colors.</p><h3>Most convenient online flower delivery service: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Benchmark Bouquets by Amazon</a></h3><p>Amazon has got into the flower delivery game with its Benchmark Bouquets brand, which unsurprisingly features affordable pricing and fast delivery. All bouquets are shipped overnight for the freshest, longest-lasting blooms, with next-day delivery included with Prime membership. Unfortunately, this delivery isn’t available on Saturday through Monday, but otherwise this is a very accessible flower delivery option through a retailer where most people already have an account. The product selection sticks to the classics, with bouquets predominantly featuring roses, lilies and alstroemeria, but there is also a category for seasonal flowers for those with more vibrant or adventurous tastes. Amazon has focused on the longevity of its blooms and therefore ships its flowers while they’re still in the bud stage. This means they will bloom 2-3 days after arrival, extending their life and value – but this may result in a slightly underwhelming bouquet if you’re buying one as a gift. However, for ease of purchase and affordability, it’s hard to argue with this selection.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: Next day available on Tuesday through Friday, free with Prime</li><li>Price range: $32+</li><li>Subscription option: No</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordably priced blooms in bright shades</li><li>Next-day delivery is included with Amazon Prime membership</li><li>Last well thanks to being shipped in bud stage</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Look less impressive upon delivery due to being shipped at bud stage</li><li>Limited delivery schedule</li><li>Displays are not particularly unique</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For maximum convenience, ease of purchase and affordability, Amazon’s Benchmark Bouquets offer long-lasting classic flower arrangements at great prices.</p><h3>Best online plant delivery service: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Sill</a></h3><p>While flower bouquets will usually only last for a week or so, a living plant could last for years if well taken care of. This makes them a gift that keeps on giving, often at a comparable price point. The Sill is a firm favorite for plant delivery, offering a wide range of greenery, as well as faux plants, ceramic planters and other related home decor. Blooming plants such as orchids are a colorful yet longer-lasting alternative to traditional bouquets, but The Sill makes it easy to find plants of all types; you can search tags such as pet-friendly, low-light and easy care. You can go bold with a tree or a bundle of plants, opt into a subscription (which includes a plant and planter each month), or play it safe with a gift card. You won’t be able to select a specific delivery date and the fees are high, but this investment will reap rewards year after year.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Shipping: No same-day delivery, free standard shipping</li><li>Price range: $34+</li><li>Subscription option: Yes</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Wide range of plants available, as well as faux plants and related decor</li><li>Good range of price points for every budget</li><li>Plants are clearly categorized to help you find the right choice, e.g. pet-friendly</li><li>Subscriptions available, with ceramic planters included</li><li>Standard shipping is all carbon-neutral</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Minimal flowering plants available</li><li>No same-day delivery</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Sill is an ideal place to find a longer-term gift of greenery, with helpful categories and a good variety of plants and prices to suit every occasion.</p><h2 id=how-to-keep-flowers-fresh>How to keep flowers fresh</h2><p>Your beautiful bouquet sadly won’t last forever, but there are several steps you can take to help preserve its freshness as long as possible. The most important ingredient? Water. “Fresh water daily,” recommends Jones. “Tip out the water from the vase your flowers are in, add water, almost let it overflow. That’s a great way to make sure you’re really cleaning out the water.” Cutting an inch off the bottom of the stems will help the flowers drink more efficiently, but the fresh water is the key ingredient.</p><p>You also want to avoid any extreme conditions, whether that’s heat, cold or direct sunlight. “Flowers definitely wilt if you keep them in that pretty window or that sunny spot on your dining room table,” she warns. You can still place them in that spot for part of the day, but be sure to move the vase into a shadier area when you’re not directly enjoying them. And don’t worry if you accidentally toss out the small packet of plant food that may be included in delivery; Jones says they can be beneficial but they definitely aren’t necessary for healthy blooms.</p><h2 id=how-i-selected-the-best-flower-delivery-services>How I selected the best flower delivery services</h2><p>In order to assemble this list of the best flower delivery services, I did extensive research in the market that assessed several key factors:</p><h4>Overall quality</h4><p>Flowers are individual living things, which means there will always be a level of variation in each bouquet ordered. However, consistency in quality and general look are always important, so that customers can feel confident in what they’re purchasing. I also assessed services on their pricing, range of styles available, shipping services, type of flower used and ability to provide gift add-ons.</p><h4>Customer service and satisfaction</h4><p>Not everyone looks for the same thing in a bouquet of flowers, so it was important to consider the perspectives of a range of potential buyers. I took into account my own experience ordering flowers and also consulted floral and event designer Lindsay Jones of Studio Jones on flower delivery, flower care and what to look for when ordering a bouquet. Finally, I incorporated the reviews of customers and other industry experts, to ensure each service on this list stood up to consistent scrutiny.</p><h2 id=how-to-find-the-best-flower-delivery-service>How to find the best flower delivery service</h2><h3>Consider average bouquet costs</h3><p>Flower arrangements come in a range of sizes and prices, from around $30 to well over $100. Depending on the occasion and your budget, you likely have an idea of how much you’d like to spend so keep that in mind when considering which service to use. Some vendors specialize in specialty blooms or more complex arrangements, while others offer bouquets at a range of price levels. Larger displays will usually cost more, while some services may offer sale pricing or holiday pricing around popular flower gifting occasions. Then, there are subscription services (similar to <a rel=alternate href=#>meal delivery services</a> or <a rel=alternate href=#>beauty subscription boxes</a>, where you select a regularly occurring delivery option). If you’re looking to buy a subscription as opposed to a one-off bouquet, then you may be able to receive discounted pricing, especially for longer subscription periods such as 12 months.</p><h3>Turnaround time</h3><p>If you’re ordering flowers to arrive on a major holiday, such as Valentine’s Day or Mother’s Day, then you will want to order early in advance if possible to guarantee delivery on time. Even if services normally offer quick shipping, the big holidays can be so busy that regular delivery windows are not possible, so plan in advance if possible. (Same advice goes for <a rel=alternate href=#>online framing services</a>, which also increase in demand close to major holidays.)</p><p>If you are spontaneously buying flowers and want them delivered as quickly as possible, don’t fret: There are several delivery services that specialize in same-day or next-day delivery. However, not everyone is able to accommodate those delivery windows so make sure to check the shipping options before you commit to a bouquet. Choosing local providers that will deliver from within a nearby radius is one way to increase the chance of fast delivery.</p><h3>Variety of arrangements available</h3><p>Depending on the occasion, your choice of bouquet may vary significantly. If you’re celebrating a milestone birthday or anniversary, you may want to go with a large statement bouquet or a bespoke arrangement from a more high-end service. “I look at their other work and look for a diversity of style and product,” says Jones, “because then I know I’m going to get something that has been thought through and not just the same-old, day-in-day-out design.” For a smaller occasion or a “just because” gift, you may want to opt for something more informal and vibrant. Some services also allow you to include additional gifts with your bouquet, such as chocolates or wine, if that matches the sentiment you’re going for.</p><p>Lastly, consider who you’re buying the flowers for and what they like. “When picking a bouquet, you really need to go for the ones that will bring the person you’re buying for the most joy,” says Jones. Are they a big fan of bright colors or do they prefer a more minimalist design? Do they favor classic flowers like roses and lilies, or do they like more unusual blooms? Most flower delivery services will feature a range of different styles, but some specialize in particular aesthetics or flower types which may suit your recipient the best. Perhaps their favorite gifts aren’t flowers at all, but instead feature tropical plants or succulents. Whatever their preference, there’s a flower delivery service for them.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How much is flower delivery?</h3><p>Flower delivery services will vary in price depending on a few key factors, such as the type of flowers you’re buying, the size of the bouquet and the speed of delivery. Rush orders are likely to cost more for same-day or next-day shipping, although some delivery services include this shipping in the sticker price. High-end florist services that use sustainably grown blooms or more complex designs will likely price their bouquets higher than mid-level services. This list includes floral delivery options for as low as $30 per bouquet, while some of the more luxurious arrangements can go for hundreds of dollars, especially if they are preserved for longevity.</p><h3>Which flower delivery service is cheapest?</h3><p>There are a number of affordably priced flower services on this list which include bouquets in the $30-50 range. If you are a Prime member, then the free shipping included with Amazon’s Benchmark Bouquet service may make that the cheapest option for you. 1-800-Flowers is reliably competitive with its pricing, as are From You Flowers and FTD Flowers. If you know that you are going to be ordering bouquets on a regular basis, then a subscription is a great way to save money, such as those offered by BloomsyBox and The Bouqs Company.</p><p>Also, consider the kind of flowers you’re buying if you want to keep things affordable. Jones recommends roses as a classic choice that is often found at a more friendly price point, but also favors another classic: daisies. “Daisies last a long time and they’re really good because people always know them,” she says.</p><h3>What is the best international flower delivery?</h3><p>The majority of flower services on the list focus on the contiguous US, but <a rel=nofollow href=#>Teleflora</a> is well regarded for its extensive network of member florists outside of North America. With 20,000 different member florists to partner with, Teleflora is a great option to consider for international flower delivery. Unfortunately, Amazon does not currently offer its Benchmark Bouquets service internationally.</p><h3>How much should I tip a flower delivery person?</h3><p>Most delivery services will include a delivery fee in their pricing, so tips are not required—but a little can still go a long way if your bouquet is being hand-delivered. Jones explains that there isn’t a set industry standard but recommends giving somewhere in between what you’d tip on a cup of coffee and what you’d tip movers. Also, consider the circumstances of delivery, such as if it’s Valentine’s Day or if the weather is very cold; these jobs will warrant a better tip.</p><h3>What is the best app to order flowers from?</h3><p>All of the flower delivery services on our list are available online, with comprehensive and easy to navigate websites that are also accessible on mobile. The majority do not have dedicated smartphone applications, but 1-800-Flowers does have a popular app that has an average rating of 4.6 with 27,000 votes. This is a convenient way to order flowers for a loved one while on the go. While you can also order flowers for delivery through the popular delivery app DoorDash, we would recommend going to a dedicated flower delivery service for higher quality bouquets and a greater selection of blooms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llqG8uLHRZpuepJmrsrPFjKycq66ZmLK0eZBo</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fbest-flower-delivery-services-1.html&title=Best%20Flower%20Delivery%20Services%20%7c%20TIME%20Stamped" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-flower-delivery-services-1.html&description=Best%20Flower%20Delivery%20Services%20%7c%20TIME%20Stamped" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-flower-delivery-services-1.html&title=Best%20Flower%20Delivery%20Services%20%7c%20TIME%20Stamped" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fbest-flower-delivery-services-1.html&title=Best%20Flower%20Delivery%20Services%20%7c%20TIME%20Stamped" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fbest-flower-delivery-services-1.html&text=Best%20Flower%20Delivery%20Services%20%7c%20TIME%20Stamped" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fbest-flower-delivery-services-1.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-06-24</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./creer-une-dynamique-de-developpement-dans-une-commune-rurale.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Crer une dynamique de dveloppement dans une commune rurale</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./1563571-nigeria-customs-advises-nigerians-job-recruitment-auctions-adverts.html><h3>You Can Reach US: Nigeria Customs Cautions Nigerians on Job Recruitment, Auction Sales Adverts >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
